                        For this course, we learnt about the ten website usability heuristics. 
                        These ten guidelines help website companies ensure that their users have good experiences on their website. 
                        <br><br>
                        Though often they don't always follow these conventions, so it makes it hard for users and the companies 
                        to use properly. 
                        <br><br>
                        We had a whole mid year exam on this.

                        We also learnt about website purpose and their user psychographics. This is essentially what the website is for and who it caters to.
                        <br><br>
                        We learnt to scan websites to see what heuristics they followed well, and what could be improved upon. 
                        <br><br>
                        They were mostly shopping websites.

                    <p>
                        The exam was about scanning two videos of someone going through two seperate websites and looking to see if the websites followed the ten heuristics.
                        <br><br>
                        We also had to note what improvements could be made and compare the two websites to see which one did it better.
