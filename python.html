                        We started learning about the python coding language and commands, such as variables, strings, integers, conventions, functions, and the various coding methods people use.
                        <br> <br>
                        Before we did the actual assessment, we played around with the code and it's functions, practising and growing our coding skills. We did a variety of exercises such as 'fill in the blanks' coding, or making a game such as paper, scissors, rock or hangman.

                        For the assessment we were required to code a quiz for year 11 students wanting to practise certain subjects. 
                        <br><br>
                        The quiz's design was to be whatever we wanted, but requiring at least one subject and ten questions.
                        <br><br>
                        I chose to have three main subjects and one fun subject, as well as having an multi choice option for users. 
                        The best part about coding was to get the code to work, the worst part was testing to see if it worked. 
                        I got a merit on my quiz. :P
